# AVAILABLE SIMULATIONS

This section contains the list of simulations available in the archives. 

## Gadget simulations
The Gadget simulations contain 30 training simulations, which are named as "mpg_{x}", where x is an integer number from 0 to 29.
Additionaly, there are 7 test simulations:
- "mpg_central": The simulation parameters are at the center of the parameter space.
- "mpg_neutrinos": The simulation contains massive neutrinos.
- "mpg_running": The simulation has a non-zero running of the spectral index.
- "mpg_growth": The growth factor of the simulation is different from that of the training set.
- "mpg_reio": The reionization history is different from that of the training set.
- "mpg_seed": Identical to the central simulation with different initial conditions. Meant to test the impact of cosmic variance. 
- "mpg_curved": The simulation has a different curvature power spectrum from that of the training set.

For information about the simulation parameters can be found in [Pedersen+21](https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.05195).

## Nyx simulations

The Nyx simulation suite contains 18 training simulations, which are named as "nyx_{x}", where x is an integer number from 0 to 17. Additionally, there are 2 test simulations:
- "nyx_central": The simulation parameters are at the center of the parameter space.
- "nyx_seed": Identical to the central simulation with different initial conditions. Meant to test the impact of cosmic variance.


For information about the simulation parameters can be found in [TBD](..).
