# Configuration file for the emulator
## Emulator label: if you want to train a predefined model, you can use the emulator_label. Other possible labels are in the README.md file.
emulator_label: "Cabayol23+"

## For the data, you can choose between loading and archive or a training set. You can only provide one of them.
### If you choose to load an archive, you can choose between Nyx or Gadget and a version.
archive:
  file: Gadget  # Can be either "Nyx" or "Gadget"
  version: "Cabayol23" #nyx version or Gadget postprocessing version

training_set: null  #Predefined training sets. You can find the options in the README.md file.

## If no emulator_label is provided, you need to provide the hyperparameters for training a new model and the emulator parameters
emulator_params: ["Delta2_p", "n_p", "alpha_p", "sigT_Mpc", "gamma", "kF_Mpc"]
hyperparameters:
  kmax_Mpc: 4
  ndeg: 5
  nepochs: 100
  step_size: 75
  drop_sim: null
  drop_z: null
  weighted_emulator: true
  nhidden: 5
  max_neurons: 50
  seed: 32
  lr0: 1e-3
  batch_size: 100
  weight_decay: 1e-4
  z_max: 10

# Where to save the trained model from the project root directory
save_path: "data/NNmodels/testing_models/test.pt"
